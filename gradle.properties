# Project versioning
#
# Keep the host application version independent from bundled plugin versions.
# This makes it easier to ship/fix internal plugins without forcing a bot release.

# Host app version (Gradle also uses this for artifact coordinates)
version=System.getenv("RELEASE_VERSION") ?: "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"

# Internal plugin versions
version_demoplugin=1.0.0
version_tachibana=1.0.0
